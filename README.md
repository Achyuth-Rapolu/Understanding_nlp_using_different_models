Understanding the NLP using Different models



This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze and understand customer sentiment based on reviews of digital products. The primary goal is to classify customer feedback as positive or negative and extract meaningful insights to inform decision-making.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Text data is cleaned to remove noise, standardize formats, and prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistics to understand the distribution of sentiments and common themes in the data.

Machine Learning Models: Several models are implemented and compared for sentiment classification, including:

Logistic Regression

Na√Øve Bayes

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Neural Networks

Evaluation Metrics: The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Customer reviews are collected from various digital product categories, including:

Apex AD2600 Progressive-scan DVD player

Canon G3

Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB

Nikon Coolpix 4300
